Greetings,
This is my first project using ReactJS, NodeJS and a database all together.

This is a short tutorial on how to run it:

After downloading the project from Github, you will need to run the front-end and the back-end code together.
You can open the project on VSCode (or another IDE you might preffer) and open 2 (two) terminals.

First, lets start the backend server, you will get on ./backend and you will run the command line "npm start".
The terminal should return "listening" to you, if it doesn't, you will need to install the npx package.

After running the backend, you can start the frontend:
On the second terminal, you will enter on ./frontend and run the command line "npm start".
It should open the application on your browser.
If it doesn't, you can click on the link on terminal holding "ctrl" button on your keyboard.

And now it's working!

Thanks for your time, it means so much to me. :)
